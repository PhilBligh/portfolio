            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a web developer, around a year into my training. I've mostly taught myself in my spare time but I'm taking my learnign to the next level by joining Makers in January.</p> 
            <p>I'm really enjoying learning - the logical, methodical nature of coding suits my mind well, and once I've made it through the Makers course I hope to embark on an exciting career in web development.</p> 
            <p>I'm a father of two, husband of one, writer of three unpublished novels, and learner of languages, getting to a point where I"m fluent in Spanish and still utterly useless at Japanese.</p>
            <p>I'm still just a beginner when it comes to web development but I've collected here some of the things I've created so far on my learning journey.</p>
